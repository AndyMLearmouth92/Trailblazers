Trailblazers is a social media platform that allows climbers, hikers and walkers to share images and content from their adventures such as location, trail names and a caption. Our aim is to bring together adventurers and share knowledge and experience of great routes and locations. The site is responsive so works on desktop, tablet and mobile.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Optimisations

For optimisations, I want to focus on adding categories and star ratings to the review form to allow users to rate their property in different areas and give it an average score out of 10. I would also add the ability to upload more than one image per review and refine the search bar.

Additional optimisations would focus on the UX, including the addition of dark mode.
